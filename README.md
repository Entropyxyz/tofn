# Thrush -- Threshold cryptography library

A threshold cryptography library in Rust.  Implements the [GG20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf) protocol.  Work in progress.

## Library name

Perhaps _Thrust_ would be a better name---it combines "threshold" with "rust".  But I like _Thrush_ better, and the logo can be a [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird)).  Perhaps _Thrush_ means "threshold" and "rush", where "rush" means "fast" as in "this library is fast".
